#### config for each sensor

# Name: when auto configure is used thie will be the Name of the device, the root of the Friendly Name, as well as the basis HA uses for creating the entity name
# Unique: name used for topic publishing and used as unique ID for HA auto config - no spaces or odd characters allowed
# Location: used with HA auto config to auto assign sensors to a specific area
# Types:
#   1 = Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC-ATC   https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer
#   2 = Govee H5052 (type 4 advertising packets)
#   3 = Govee H5072
#   4 = Govee H5102
#   5 = Govee H5075
#   6 = Govee H5074 (type 4 advertising packets)
#  99 = Display raw type 0 and type 4 advertising packets for this BLE MAC address
# MAC: the MAC address of the sensor
